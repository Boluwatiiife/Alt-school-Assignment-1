    <p><b>NAME:</b> Tunde-Lawal Boluwatife</p>
    <p><b>ALT SCHOOL ID:</b> ALT/SOE/025/1306</p>
    <p>
      <h3>BIOGRAPHY:</h3> I was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and I am currently an undergraduate at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, in Osun State,
    where I am studying Computer Science and Engineering. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to pursue
    this field, as I enjoy understanding how systems work and building solutions that can have a real world impact.
    
    <p>Beyond academics, I have a strong interest in backend development and have been actively learning and working on
    projects to deepen my understanding of server-side technologies, databases, and API development. My goal is to become a
    highly skilled backend developer capable of building efficient and scalable systems for real-world applications.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing football, listening to music, and playing video games. These activities help me relax
    and stay balanced while improving my teamwork and strategic thinking skills. I am continuously working on improving my
    technical skills, and I look forward to growing in the field of software development while making meaningful
    contributions to the tech industry.</p>
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>why did i join the program?</h3>
    I joined AltSchool because I want to become a highly skilled backend developer. I had already started learning backend
    development on my own, writing code and building small projects, but I quickly realized that there was so much more to
    learn and explore. The backend ecosystem is vast, and without proper guidance, itâ€™s easy to get lost learning things
    that might not be relevant or structured in the right order.
    <p>
    I knew I needed a well-structured learning path that would help me focus on the right skills, technologies, and best
    practices while also giving me hands-on experience. I had heard a lot of great things about AltSchool, particularly how
    it provides a solid curriculum, mentorship, and real-world projects that help students grow into industry-ready
    developers.
    </p>
    
    One of my friends who graduated from AltSchool is now a skilled developer, working in the industry and earning well.
    Seeing his progress and how much he learned through the program inspired me to apply. I wanted to be part of a community
    where I could learn alongside other students, collaborate on projects, and grow significantly throughout the course of
    the program. Joining AltSchool felt like the right step toward achieving my goal of becoming an excellent backend
    developer and securing opportunities in the tech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>my goals for the School of Engineering program: </h3>
      by the end of the program i hope to:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Master Backend Development:</b> By the end of the program, I want to be a fully realized backend developer, not just
        someone who knows the basics but someone who deeply understands how backend systems work.</li>
        <li> <b>Write and Explain Complex Backend Code:</b> I want to be able to write, optimize, and explain complex backend logic,
        ensuring efficiency, scalability, and security in my applications.</li>
        <li> <b>Gain Hands-on Experience:</b> I aim to work on multiple real-world projects, build APIs, integrate databases, and handle
        authentication, making me industry-ready.</li>
        <li><b>Develop Problem-Solving Skills:</b> I want to sharpen my problem-solving abilities by tackling challenging coding problems,
        data structures, and algorithms, which are essential for backend development.</li>
        <li><b>Secure a Junior Backend Developer Role:</b> I want to acquire enough knowledge and experience to work as a junior backend
        developer in a reputable tech company after completing the program.</li>
        <li> <b>Contribute Massively to My Future Workplace:</b> I want to add value to any company I join by writing efficient code,
        collaborating with teams, and continuously improving backend systems.</li>
        <li><b>Continue Learning and Growing:</b> Beyond getting my first job, I want to keep learning, upskilling, and eventually grow
        into a senior backend engineer, contributing to large-scale projects and mentoring others.</li>
      </ul>
